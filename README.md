# Personal blog

This is the source code for my personal blog, which is built using [Nuxt 4](https://nuxt.com) and hosted on GitHub Pages. The content is written in Markdown and handled by [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com).

Feel free to visit [alxdrcirilo.dev](https://alxdrcirilo.dev) to see the live version of the blog. I try to keep the content updated with my latest projects and thoughts on various topics 🌻

## Structure

The blog is structured as follows:

```yaml
.

├── LICENSE               # Project license

└── src                   # Main source code

```

## Local development

I'm using [Bun](https://bun.sh) as my JavaScript runtime. To get started, you need to have Bun installed on your machine.

### Installation

After installing Bun, you can clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

This will install the dependencies, start the development server, and you can view the blog at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Formatting

To format the code, you can use the following command:

```bash
bun run format
```

Under the hood, this uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to ensure consistent code style across the project.

## Deployment

The blog is deployed using GitHub Actions. The deployment workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. It builds the project and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch, which is then served by GitHub Pages.
