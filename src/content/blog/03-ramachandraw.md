## Preface

In late 2019, right before the start of the [COVID-19](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19) pandemic, I vaguely recall coming upon the idea of creating a Python package - for practice but also for fun. At that time, I was following a Master in Computer Science with a specialization in Bioinformatics at the University of Leiden (the Netherlands).

As is the case in many other fields, there is a plethora of tools written in Python available to the greater public through individual or communal efforts. In Bioinformatics, a very good example of a large Python package with broad usability is [Biopython](https://biopython.org). In other words, we don't want to reinvent the wheel. Since this would be my first Python package, I would have to start small and be realistic about my expectations and goals. I spent some time devising what gap I could fill, or in which domain I could build something that would be truly useful and improve the productivity of the scientific community (or the greater public at large). I realized that there was no package available on PyPi[^1] that could draw a [Ramachandran plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramachandran_plot) in a straightforward fashion, yet still allowing a highly-customizable setup, and providing relevant information (e.g. dictionary of œÜ and œà torsion angles).

### Ramachandran plot

Proteins are made up of aminoacid residues linked together in what we call a "polypeptide chain". There are two main torsion (dihedral) angles in this chain: _Phi_ (œÜ) and _Psi_ (œà), defining the rotations of the polypeptide backbone around the bonds between N-CŒ±, and CŒ±-C, respectively[^2].

Developed by G. N. Ramachandran et al. in 1963, the Ramachandran plot serves as a way to visualize energetically allowed (or favoured) regions for torsion angles œÜ against œà. It can be used in two main ways:

1. **Assessment of protein structure quality**: assess the accuracy/plausibility of protein structures by analyzing backbone torsion angles against allowed regions
2. **Secondary structure identification**: identify secondary structure elements like Œ±-helices and Œ≤-sheets by their characteristic patterns in the plot

## Building a Python package

The first version of [`ramachandraw`](https://github.com/alxdrcirilo/ramachandraw) was released on PyPi a little over 4 years ago (December 2019). At that time, I used `setup.py` in combination with `setuptools` for the packaging and distribution of the project. I vaguely recall the whole process being rather clunky and unintuitive, but perhaps that was mostly due to my lack of experience.

Nowadays, we have a more modern approach to packaging in Python thanks to `pyproject.toml` (defined in [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) and [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/)). If present in a Python project, this file will be placed at the root of the directory structure. In a nutshell, `pyproject.toml` defines the project metadata and dependencies in a declarative manner. The concerns (e.g. tooling and project author(s)) are clearly separated, dependency management is also improved, and it integrates well with different tooling widely adopted by the community (e.g. `poetry` [supports it](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/)).

Here's the `pyproject.toml` defined in [`ramachandraw-1.0.1`](https://pypi.org/project/ramachandraw/1.0.1/):

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "ramachandraw"
version = "1.0.1"
description = "Ramachandran plotting tool"
authors = ["Alexandre Cirilo"]
license = "MIT"
readme = "README.md"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.9"
matplotlib = "^3.8.3"
biopython = "^1.83"

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
mypy = "^1.8.0"
pyclean = "^2.7.6"
pytest = "^8.0.1"
pytest-coverage = "^0.0"
ruff = "^0.2.2"
scipy = "^1.12.0"

[build-system]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
requires = ["poetry-core"]

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["I", "F401"]
ignore-init-module-imports = true
```

> Since I used `poetry`, some of the TOML sections are named differently (e.g. `[tool.poetry]` instead of `[project]`).

### Using **poetry**

#### Declaring dependencies

One of the nicest features of using `poetry` in combination with the `pyproject.toml` file is that you can have so-called [dependency groups](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-dependencies/#dependency-groups). With dependency groups, you can categorize dependencies within a Python project based on their purpose. For example, with `ramachandraw`, there are a couple of tools that we only need in our virtual environment when developing - these will be defined in `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]`. The dependencies that are required for the Python project (part of the implicit `main` group) are defined in `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`. Say you want to add the `ipython` package when working on improving the project, you can simply run the following in your terminal:

```shell
poetry add ipython --group dev
```

> üìù **Reminder**: The virtual environment needs to be activated.

#### Building the project

Once the project is ready to be built, `poetry` helps us once again with a very convenient one-liner:

```shell
poetry build
```

Running this command in the terminal will build the source and generate a [wheel](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/) file in the `dist` directory (unless explicitly declared using `--output (-o)`).

#### Publishing the project to PyPi

Before publishing the Python package to PyPi, you should test it out using the rightly called [Test PyPi](https://test.pypi.org). First, configure `poetry` to use the store token that can be generated using your (Test) PyPi account:

```shell
# Test PyPi
poetry config pypi-token.test-pypi pypi-YYYYYYYY

# Production PyPi
poetry config pypi-token.pypi pypi-XXXXXXXX
```

Then, simply publish to PyPi (after testing on Test PyPi):

```shell
# Test PyPi
poetry publish -r test-pypi

# Production PyPi
poetry publish
```

### Unit testing

One very important aspect of software development that I omitted in the first versions (`0.x.x`) of `ramachandraw` is unit testing. Unit testing allows the testing of parts (i.e. units) of the code. With proper testing implemented, we can catch potential bugs early on, ensure that the changes we introduce comply with how we envisioned the software to work, and improve code maintainability.

For this project, I use the popular [`pytest`](https://pytest.org) testing framework. The tests are run automatically on every `push` to the `master` branch using **GitHub actions**. The coverage report (including the proportion of the codebase that is covered by tests) is uploaded to [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/alxdrcirilo/ramachandraw?branch=master).

Here's what running `pytest` and explicitly requesting the coverage statistics looks like:

```shell
‚ùØ pytest --cov=ramachandraw
======================== test session starts ========================

## Using **ramachandraw**

As of `ramachandraw-1.0.0`, the package is only supported in `Python 3.9-3.12`. To install the package from PyPi using `pip`, simply run:

```shell
pip install ramachandraw
```

Or, if using `poetry`:

```shell
poetry add ramachandraw
```

The documentation can be found in the `README.md` file on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alxdrcirilo/ramachandraw). All functions include docstrings which most modern IDEs[^3] support - these will help you remain efficient when developing and using `ramachandraw` without the need of checking the official documentation.

### Example

Here's a simple example of fetching human deoxyhaemoglobin - [`4hhb`](https://www.wwpdb.org/pdb?id=pdb_00004hhb), from the [wwPDB](https://www.wwpdb.org)[^4]:

[^4]: Worldwide Protein Data Bank

```py
from ramachandraw.utils import fetch_pdb

hemoglobin = fetch_pdb(pdb_id='4hhb')
```

To extract the œÜ and œà torsion angles, use the `get_phi_psi` function:

```py
from ramachandraw.parser import get_phi_psi

phi_psi(pdb_filepath=hemoglobin)
```

Lastly, to draw the Ramachandran plot, run the `plot` function:

```py
from ramachandraw.utils import plot

plot(pdb_filepath=hemoglobin)
```

The `ramachandraw` Python pacakge supports plotting single PDB files or batches of multiple PDB files. Simply provide a `list` or `tuple` of PDB ids instead of a single `str`.
